The Granit frontend SDK provides **TypeScript-first packages** with optional React
bindings. Each package follows a two-tier architecture: a headless TypeScript SDK
(framework-agnostic) and a React integration layer.

## Quick start

Head to the [Quick Start guide](/frontend/getting-started/quick-start/) to set up
your first Granit-powered frontend application.
